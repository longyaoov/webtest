/** The above CSS styling is not reflecting correctly, 
but to display an idea: 
Header has a white border at the bottom, the rest of the webpage has a white background 
and a grid with a gap of 20px and padding of 20px, and product boxes have white borders and centers. Product icons are shown as a colored rectangle, i.e., white for black background and black for white background. **/
