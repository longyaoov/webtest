And the recent reemergence of this Lipton Cup shines a light both on the story of the man himself and on the modern history of the country of his ancestors.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">Lipton's parents were from Clones, but moved to Glasgow during the Famine years. Thus the future tycoon was born in 1848 in the notorious Gorbals, where he grew up in abject poverty. But the family opened a small grocery business after a time, and his own flair for business became quickly evident.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">Refused a pay increase (from four to five shillings a week) in his late teens, he sailed to New York, and made enough money in a few years there to return to Glasgow and buy his own shop. From then on, his Lipton stores multiplied –  there would be hundreds eventually  –  propelling him en route into the tea business that made his name.</p><div id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0"></div><div><div style="border-block-start: 4px solid var(--global-neutral-2);font-family:var(--font-family-secondary);font-weight: var(--c-heading-font-weight);font-size:1.1rem; padding-top:0.8rem;margin-top:2rem;">READ MORE</div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0frCB4hReP77YJ-3-4-0"></div><p class="c-paragraph paywall">Lipton’s attachment to the land of his parents was a mixture of the emotional and the pragmatic. Of his time in the US, he quipped that he was either “a Scottish Irishman or an Irish Scot, according to the leanings of the company I happen to be in at the moment”.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">But much of the food for his stores came from Ireland, via Westport in particular, which at one time was supplying 6,000 hams, 16,000 eggs, 16 tons of bacon and 10 tons of butter every week.</p><div id="arcad-feature-f0fA5zOjVt7q5My-3-4-3-12d4ec98fef3e7" class="default__StyledAdUnit-sc-1moicrg-0 gKEhzJ arcad-feature" style="--mobile-display:block;--tablet-display:block;--desktop-display:block"><div class="arcad-container width_100" style="max-width:550px"><div id="arcad_f0fA5zOjVt7q5My-3-4-3-12d4ec98fef3e7" class="arcad ad-550x250"></div></div></div><p class="c-paragraph paywall">As a wealthy man, he named his residential yacht "Erin". And the five different vessels with which he tried to win the America's Cup were each named <em>Shamrock</em>. He was planning a sixth <em>Shamrock</em>, and yet another attempt on the trophy, when he died aged 81.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">By then, his obituary in this newspaper had to remind readers that he was a Scot, despite the “popular misconception” of his Irishness. His will underlined the emigrant reality. Unmarried and with no offspring, he left his fortune to the poor of Glasgow, with particular reference to women and children.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">There are many stories about Lipton’s marketing genius. One concerns a journey to Ceylon in the late 1880s, when the ship ran into trouble in the Red Sea and had to dump cargo to lighten the load. In the midst of the crisis, he disappeared below deck briefly and returned with a stencil, brush, and paint, before inscribing all the crates to be thrown overboard with “Use Lipton’s Tea”.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">Having dispatched these free advertisements to the Arabian coast, he then made sure –  once the ship reached port –  to be first to telegraph news of its safety back to London, ensuring his name was carried by all the newspapers.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">Even his sporting setbacks were turned into good press. So well known did he become, not just for losing in the America’s Cup, but for losing with grace, his US hosts struck a special trophy just for him. The then mayor of New York joked it was for “possibly the world’s worst yacht builder, but absolutely the world’s most cheerful loser”.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">As for the aforementioned Lipton Cup –  the one for Irish soccer –  it was donated to a club in Clones in 1913. The club inaugurated a competition for it, with teams in the Cavan-Monaghan-Fermanagh triangle, during the fateful season of 1913-14. And therein lies the explanation why the trophy was played for only once.</p><div id="arcad-feature-f0fq2HIufcDr5Mt-3-4-4-f7b6c2fca0aa7" class="default__StyledAdUnit-sc-1moicrg-0 gKEhzJ arcad-feature" style="--mobile-display:block;--tablet-display:block;--desktop-display:block"><div class="arcad-container width_100" style="max-width:550px"><div id="arcad_f0fq2HIufcDr5Mt-3-4-4-f7b6c2fca0aa7" class="arcad ad-550x250"></div></div></div><p class="c-paragraph paywall">In was won by Enniskillen Corinthians. Then the Great War intervened, and after that the Troubles, then another war, then more Troubles. Somewhere along the way the Lipton Cup went underground, with the idea that it not be played for again until there was peace in the world, or at least this part of it.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">The cup passed into the safe-keeping of a Clones solicitor, Joseph Black, and later his son Richard. Then last week, 100 years after August 1914, it re-emerged shining into the light, unveiled at a war commemoration by the new Minister for the Arts, Heather Humphreys.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">The immediate future of the trophy –  older than the FAI Cup by a decade –  is unclear. But the general intention is to press it back into service soon, in some cross-Border competition. Talks are under way to this effect. If I were Clones Football Club, I might also be consulting tea-leaves.</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">@FrankmcnallyIT</p><p class="c-paragraph paywall">fmcnally@irishtimes.com</p></article><div id="lazy_55731" class="lazy_container"><div class="b-flex-chain"><div class="b-flex-chain__grid-container b-flex-chain__grid-container__12 gap"><div class="c-stack grid-item " data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"><div data-testid="article-container" class="c-stack b-article-tag" data-style-direction="horizontal" data-style-justification="center" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="wrap"><a class="c-pill" href="/tags/lipton/">Lipton</a><a class="c-pill" href="/tags/heather-humphreys/">Heather Humphreys</a><a class="c-pill" href="/tags/joseph-black/">Joseph Black</a><a class="c-pill" href="/tags/thomas-lipton/">Thomas Lipton</a></div><div class="c-stack b-flex-promo-list-block" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap" style="--c-stack-gap:1rem"></div><div class="floating-subscribe"></div><div id="arcad-feature-f0fxlXV57SJ370m-3-5-3-9070d80fd19ad" class="default__StyledAdUnit-sc-1moicrg-0 gKEhzJ arcad-feature" style="--mobile-display:block;--tablet-display:block;--desktop-display:block"><div class="arcad-container width_100" style="max-width:728px"><div id="arcad_f0fxlXV57SJ370m-3-5-3-9070d80fd19ad" class="arcad ad-728x90"></div></div></div><hr class="c-divider b-it-divider-block"/><div class="c-grid b-it-header-block"><div class="b-it-header-block__header-block  font-normal

Leandro Trossard fizzed just wide after a nice pass from Gabriel Magalhães but it was an isolated incision. And then United blew the game open. It was a sucker punch, Garnacho driving up the inside right and being tripped by Trossard outside the box, to the right of centre.","type":"text"},{"_id":"W3C6ZYJ3GFE73EFJQDWABGHW6M","additional_properties":{},"content":"Arsenal’s defensive wall looked quite a way back and what about Raya’s positioning? It was strange to see him leave a big space to his left-hand post, which was clearly where Fernandes was going to aim. Although Raya shuffled across when Fernandes stepped forward, he was still to the right of centre. Fernandes’s kick was hardly in the corner. Raya flew across and was nowhere near it.","type":"text"},{"_id":"LNI3ORM3TJBK5LWHYDCU2QYPQM","additional_properties":{},"content":"United brought more intent after the interval, more drive. Joshua Zirkzee, playing as the No 9 after Amorim dropped Rasmus Højlund, finally got a hold-up move to work, getting Diogo Dalot away and Mazraoui met the cross with a volley. Raya saved brilliantly with his legs. The goalkeeper had to work again when Zirkzee flicked a deflected Garnacho cross with his trailing leg. Raya’s reflexes were on point.","type":"text"},{"_id":"BK7CFAQJSZDWZJDLGP3EOCY2BE","additional_properties":{},"content":"Ødegaard went close shortly after the restart, Onana helping his drive over the crossbar but when the Arsenal captain hit the wall from a well-placed free-kick on 70 minutes, it was starting to look bleak for his team.

Gabriel Martinelli, back as a substitute after injury, worked Onana, who also spilled a late Ødegaard effort. But it was United who looked the likelier scorers of the next goal. If only Højlund, who came on for Zirkzee, had been quicker when Casemiro played him in; Rice got back to make a saving challenge. The Dane was also denied by a robust Gabriel challenge. And then, at the bitter end, there was Fernandes.
