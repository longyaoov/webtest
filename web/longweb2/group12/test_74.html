        <p>First Jay Z made the “Song Cry,” and now he’s the one with tears in his eyes. The Roc Nation mogul got emotional while penning his nostalgic verse on Jeezy’s <a href="/2014/06/30/new-music-young-jeezy-f-jay-z-seen-it-all">“Seen It All.”</a></p>
        <p>Hov reminisces about his drug-dealing past on the Cardo-produced single off the Atlanta rapper’s upcoming album <em>Seen It All</em>.</p>
        <p>It took Jay 30-40 minutes to lay down his verse, which brought up many memories from his hustling days.</p>
        <p>“We got on the phone and [Jay] was like, ‘Yo, Jeezy, when I was writing the verse I had tears in my eyes, man,’ because it took him so far back to Marcy,” the Snowman told <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/1869645/jeezy-seen-it-all-jay-z-tears/">MTV News</a>. “Every bar in that song was real—I put my hand on the Bible.”</p>
        <p>But there will be “No Tears” on his collaboration with Future. Jizzle flew to St. Thomas this week to shoot a video for the sentimental song, which features an ’80s soft-rock vibe.</p>
        <p>“I can never let a tear fall down my face, I’m losing all my friends like every single day,” sings a reggae-tinged Future.</p>
        <p>Due September 2, <em>Seen It All</em> also features the tracks “Me OK,” “Black Eskimo,” and “Enough.”</p>
