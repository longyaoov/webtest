data-event-element="inline link" href="http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html">is now the proud owner</a> of 1,030 IBM software patents. The search giant did not disclose the purchase price, but based on a separate bidding war earlier this month, we're guessing it was high. In that episode, Nortel sold over 6,000 patents to Microsoft, Apple and a few other giants for a cool $4.5 billion in cash, while Google lost the war after an attention-getting bid of pi billion dollars ($3.14159 billion).</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We wondered then, and we're wondering again: What the heck are those patents for? And why did they cost as much as a small island nation? Google's a big, rich company, but their bid for the Nortel patents is almost equal to their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html"><em>entire research and development budget</em></a> in 2010. This seems even more remarkable because based on the comments from their top lawyer, Google doesn't want patents to build new products. They want them to be a sort of litigation shield.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/patents-and-innovation.html">wrote on the company blog</a> in April that they were engaging in the bidding war to "create a disincentive for others to sue Google." Walker explained:</p><div class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi"><blockquote class="">The tech world has recently seen an explosion in patent litigation, often involving low-quality software patents, which threatens to stifle innovation. …<br/> <br/> But as things stand today, one of a company’s best defenses against this kind of litigation is (ironically) to have a formidable patent portfolio, as this helps maintain your freedom to develop new products and services.
