                            <p>The intimate combination of guitar and voice is live today with two of its finest proponents, Robin Tritschler and Xuefei Yang. And Aldeburgh Music's Friday Afternoons project, which encouraged schools around the world last year to get singing, was such a success that it returns tomorrow. Today hear the girls' choir of Queen's College Preparatory School London perform some of the newly commissioned songs live in the In Tune Studio. Sean also goes to the National Gallery to meet the artist Maggi Hambling as her 'Walls of Water' exhibition opens there. </p>
