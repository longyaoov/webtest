article-sections"><p class="">It was an emotional hearing at the Tuesday night meeting over whether Boston should return to an elected school committee.</p><p class="">The three-hour City Council Education Committee meeting covered a lot of ground. But in the end, most of the comments shared one common theme: The voices of the community are not being heard.</p><p class="indent-medium">"The real issue is whether or not the Boston School Committee is truly accountable to the needs of Boston families, students and educators," said Brandy Oakley, the executive director of Educators for Excellence Boston, a teacher-led policy advocacy group.</p><p class="indent-medium">"Every voice has to matter," she added. "And there must be multiple avenues for engagement."</p><p class="">She explained the vast majority of her group's members oppose the current structure. Right now, all school committee members are chosen by the mayor from a list of candidates developed by a citizen nominating commission. Oakley said that ultimately gives too much power to one person.</p><p class="">The hearing was organized by Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George, who began speaking about starting an official dialogue like this in January, following community frustration over the school committee's vote to change <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/12/22/boston-school-start-times-shelved">school start times</a>. Many parents criticized the process behind the time changes as well as the schedule shifts, and the district eventually shelved the plans.</p><p class="indent-medium">"That effort to change the school start and end times and not really include school communities in that conversation really put a lot of people over the edge when we talk about the role of the school committee and making education decisions," she said.</p><p class="">Essaibi-George said that she's personally not convinced an elected school committee is the answer, but added that it is past time to publicly examine the current system.</p><section class="section--bp"><div class="uw bp--outer"><div class="bp-inner"><p class="bp-label">Advertisement</p><div class="bp-content bp-content--centered"><div id="adslot-1"></div></div></div></div></section><p class="indent-medium">"The public has not had an opportunity to talk out loud, in a formal setting, on the record about what their experience has been with the school committee," she explained.</p><p class="">Mayor Marty Walsh was not at the meeting, but he rejected the idea of moving away from an appointed committee.</p><p class="indent-medium">"When it was elected, it was a disaster," he said.</p><p class="">The city switched to its current mayoral-appointment structure in 1992, after mounting criticism over student performance, budget deficits and corruption. Boston is the only municipal school district in Massachusetts with an appointment system. In fact, the vast majority of school boards in the U.S. are elected, with the exception of large cities like Chicago and New York City, which also have appointed school board members.</p><p class="">Walsh argued that since doing away with school committee elections, the governing body has been running with better representation and more stability.</p><p class="">Former City Councilor Lawrence DiCara, a panelist at the hearing, also opposed the idea of moving away from an appointed body. He said the 1970s were not a good era for the Boston Public School Committee.</p><p class="indent-medium">"There were some decent people who served on those committees. But there were many who ran only because there was an available office," said DiCara. He argued that mayoral committee appointments actually increase accountability because the mayor is fully accountable for the public education system.</p><p class="">But most at the meeting insisted times have changed. They argued the school committee currently runs at the behest of the mayor and the only way to truly meet the needs of the local community is to restore the democratic process.</p><p class="indent-medium">"Democracy is messy," said Mary Battenfeld, a member of the grassroots parent advocacy group Quality Education for Every Student (QUEST). "A lot can go wrong. But that doesn’t mean we should do wrong in return."</p><p class="">Additional discussion about this issue is expected in the coming months. But Essaibi-George says formal recommendations and final decisions are likely years away.</p></section><section class="article-section--story-group article-section--centered"><p class=""><em>This

In this intimate journey, Maria explores what Selena's legacy shows us about belonging in America.","Editors’ Notes: Mexican-American recording artist Selena Quintanilla not only popularized Tejano music to mainstream American audiences but also helped put Latinos on the map and broke barriers of all kinds before her untimely passing in 1995. Journalist María García initially took notice of her talent when she was only seven years old. “I couldn’t articulate this when I was younger, but I felt it—a profound sense that she mattered, not just because of her music but because of her expansive cultural impact,” García tells Apple Podcasts.","On her podcast \u003cem\u003eAnything for Selena\u003c/em\u003e, Apple Podcasts’ Show of the Year of 2021, García, who most recently served as Managing Editor for Boston public radio station WBUR, combines rigorous reporting with impassioned storytelling to honor her legacy. She also explores the indelible mark she left on Latino identity and belonging, whether it’s fatherhood, big-butt politics, and the fraught relationship with whiteness and language.","Though she sees the show as a personal journey “to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” García felt it was important to make sense of how she profoundly touched the hearts and minds of many. “It’s not a biography podcast. Instead, we tried to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” she says. “So many people wrote to me telling me the storytelling in the podcast made them feel seen.\""],"nprID":null,"sources":[],"hasLanding":true,"isSource":true,"archived":false,"facebookURL":"","syndicationURL":"","phone":"","email":"","airTimes":"","hostPhoto":null,"podcastRSS":"https://rss.wbur.org/anythingforselena/podcast","podcastItunes":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anything-for-selena/id1535265016","podcastGoogle":"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3Mud2J1ci5vcmcvYW55dGhpbmdmb3JzZWxlbmEvcG9kY2FzdA","podcastTuneIn":"","podcastSpotify":"https://open.spotify.com/show/1aCcf9CN3cunTBdkIzYTvo?si=rfPpWnCVR0KqJrwEP9MkkQ","podcastRadioPublic":"https://radiopublic.com/anything-for-selena-GZQvY9","podcastNprOne":"","podcastAzMusic":"","podcastEpisodeDesc":"","podcastUnpublish":false,"itunesType":"serial","itunesCategory":"Society \u0026 Culture","itunesSubCategory":"","itunesAuthor":"WBUR \u0026 Futuro Studios","itunesKeywords":"selena, Quintanilla, Maria Garcia, wbur, futuro"},{"comment_status":"closed","comment_count":0,"id":117,"title":"Arts \u0026 Culture","source":"arts-culture","description":"","type":"news-section","relativeURL":"/news/section/arts-culture","apiURL":"https://api.wbur.org/channels/arts-culture","externalURL":null,"miniExcerpt":"","images":{"tile":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-200x200.jpeg","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-400x400.jpeg","width":400,"height":400},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-768x768.jpeg","width":768,"height":768},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-1000x1000.jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-600x600.jpeg","width":600,"height":600},"breakout":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-1920x1920.jpeg","width":1920,"height":1920},"superbreakout":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-2560x2560.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture.jpeg","width":3000,"height":3000}},"app_banner":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo.png","width":1242,"height":3000}},"app_wallpaper":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern.png","width":1242,"height":3000}}},"content":["The ARTery is your destination for news and thoughtful conversation about Boston’s arts and culture.

Co-hosts Ben Brock Johnson and Amory Sivertson, along with producer Josh Swartz, investigate how the stigma around mental illness combined with government secrecy can silence the truth and, ultimately, accountability for disturbing outcomes.","In this feed you'll also find \u003cem\u003eBeyond All Repair — \u003c/em\u003eA 10-part investigative podcast from WBUR and ZSP Media. The series tells the story of Sophia Johnson, who was accused of killing her mother-in-law, Marlyne Johnson, in 2002. Sophia was 23 years old and six months pregnant at the time. She swears she’s innocent, but someone says he witnessed the murder: Sophia’s own brother, Sean, whose account was the one detectives ultimately believed. Over three years, Sophia tells her story to WBUR’s Amory Sivertson. Sophia wants justice for her mother-in-law, to meet the son she hasn't seen since giving birth to him while incarcerated for the murder, and to set the story straight, once and for all. But is she telling the truth?","And \u003cem\u003eViolation\u003c/em\u003e — A podcast from WBUR and The Marshall Project that tells the story of how a horrible crime connected two families for decades. It explores suffering and retribution, as well as power and privilege. The series also pulls back the curtain on parole boards — powerful, secretive, largely political bodies that control the fates of thousands of people every year. Hosted and reported by The Marshall Project’s Beth Schwartzapfel."],"nprID":null,"sources":[],"hasLanding":true,"isSource":true,"archived":false,"facebookURL":"","syndicationURL":"","phone":"","email":"","airTimes":"","hostPhoto":null,"podcastRSS":"https://rss.wbur.org/violation/rss","podcastItunes":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/violation/id1675527305","podcastGoogle":"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3Mud2J1ci5vcmcvdmlvbGF0aW9uL3Jzcw","podcastTuneIn":"https://tunein.com/podcasts/True-Crime/Violation-p3521023/","podcastSpotify":"https://open.spotify.com/show/6b0q5xWN9RSGNpTDIRIIFp","podcastRadioPublic":"https://radiopublic.com/violation-GAvkVj","podcastNprOne":"","podcastAzMusic":"https://music.amazon.ca/podcasts/d9fea60d-1420-4145-adcf-394a6b767943/violation","podcastEpisodeDesc":"","podcastUnpublish":false,"itunesType":"serial","itunesCategory":"True Crime","itunesSubCategory":"","itunesAuthor":"WBUR","itunesKeywords":"criminal justice, true crime"},{"comment_status":"closed","comment_count":0,"id":107,"title":"Boston University World of Ideas","source":"worldofideas","description":"Discussions and lectures by the best and brightest thinkers from Boston University","type":"program","relativeURL":"/radio/programs/worldofideas","apiURL":"https://api.wbur.org/channels/worldofideas","externalURL":null,"miniExcerpt":"Discussions and lectures by the best and brightest thinkers from Boston University","images":{"tile":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas-200x200.jpg","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas-400x400.jpg","width":400,"height":400},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas-768x768.jpg","width":768,"height":768},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas-1000x1000.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas-600x600.jpg","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-world-of-ideas.jpg","width":1400,"height":1400}}},"content":["Discussions and lectures by the best and brightest thinkers from Boston University"],"nprID":null,"sources":[],"hasLanding":true,"isSource":true,"archived":true,"facebookURL":"","syndicationURL":"","phone":"","email":"","airTimes":"","hostPhoto":null,"podcastRSS":"https://rss.wbur.org/worldofideas/podcast","podcastItunes":"","podcastGoogle":"","podcastTuneIn":"","podcastSpotify":"","podcastRadioPublic":"","podcastNprOne":"","podcastAzMusic":"","podcastEpisodeDesc":"Discussions and lectures by the best and brightest thinkers from \u003ca href=\"https://www.bu.edu/\"\u003eBoston University\u003c/a\u003e","podcastUnpublish":true,"itunesType":"episodic","itunesCategory":"Arts","itunesSubCategory":"","itunesAuthor":"WBUR","itunesKeywords":""},{"comment_status":"closed","comment_count":0,"id":125,"title":"Bulger on Trial","source":"bulger-on-trial","description":"James \"Whitey\" Bulger is charged with 19 murders.

But in the end, most of the comments shared one common theme: The voices of the community are not being heard.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"inset\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","\"The real issue is whether or not the Boston School Committee is truly accountable to the needs of Boston families, students and educators,\" said Brandy Oakley, the executive director of Educators for Excellence Boston, a teacher-led policy advocacy group.","\"Every voice has to matter,\" she added. \"And there must be multiple avenues for engagement.\"","She explained the vast majority of her group's members oppose the current structure. Right now, all school committee members are chosen by the mayor from a list of candidates developed by a citizen nominating commission. Oakley said that ultimately gives too much power to one person.","The hearing was organized by Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George, who began speaking about starting an official dialogue like this in January, following community frustration over the school committee's vote to change \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/12/22/boston-school-start-times-shelved\"\u003eschool start times\u003c/a\u003e. Many parents criticized the process behind the time changes as well as the schedule shifts, and the district eventually shelved the plans.","\"That effort to change the school start and end times and not really include school communities in that conversation really put a lot of people over the edge when we talk about the role of the school committee and making education decisions,\" she said.","Essaibi-George said that she's personally not convinced an elected school committee is the answer, but added that it is past time to publicly examine the current system.","\u003cspan data-index=\"109\" data-type=\"ad\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","\"The public has not had an opportunity to talk out loud, in a formal setting, on the record about what their experience has been with the school committee,\" she explained.","Mayor Marty Walsh was not at the meeting, but he rejected the idea of moving away from an appointed committee.","\"When it was elected, it was a disaster,\" he said.","The city switched to its current mayoral-appointment structure in 1992, after mounting criticism over student performance, budget deficits and corruption. Boston is the only municipal school district in Massachusetts with an appointment system. In fact, the vast majority of school boards in the U.S. are elected, with the exception of large cities like Chicago and New York City, which also have appointed school board members.","Walsh argued that since doing away with school committee elections, the governing body has been running with better representation and more stability.","Former City Councilor Lawrence DiCara, a panelist at the hearing, also opposed the idea of moving away from an appointed body. He said the 1970s were not a good era for the Boston Public School Committee.","\"There were some decent people who served on those committees. But there were many who ran only because there was an available office,\" said DiCara. He argued that mayoral committee appointments actually increase accountability because the mayor is fully accountable for the public education system.","But most at the meeting insisted times have changed. They argued the school committee currently runs at the behest of the mayor and the only way to truly meet the needs of the local community is to restore the democratic process.","\"Democracy is messy,\" said Mary Battenfeld, a member of the grassroots parent advocacy group Quality Education for Every Student (QUEST). \"A lot can go wrong.
