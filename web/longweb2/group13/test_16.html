Kiel, the towering actor known for playing the villain Jaws in two James Bond movies, has died at age 74.

But it was his role as the hulking assassin who killed his prey with a rack of steel-capped teeth in a pair of Bond films that catapulted him to the top rank of movie villains. Kiel battled Roger Moore in both <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> and <i>Moonraker.</i> The teeth were so uncomfortable that he could only wear them for 35 seconds at a time.

former Border Patrol agent admitted that he ordered women to show him their breasts to enter the U.S. Shane Millan, 53, pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of deprivation of rights under color of law,

Millan, who would conduct virtual hearings at the Eagle Pass crossing in Texas while based in Jefferson County, New York, asked a woman with a one-year-old child to show him a “tattoo” on her chest, the newspaper reported. When she denied having one, he pressed her twice to remove her shirt to prove it. After she did for the second time, he reportedly told her, “OK … Welcome to the USA.” Millan also allegedly looked up Spanish translations for phrases such as “I will need you to lift your shirt and bra also, please” and “to verify, I will need you to lift your shirt, please.” “He told these women that his requests were for legitimate searches incident to admission into the United States, but he knew his demands to see the victims’ breasts were for his own gratification,” prosecutors said in a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndny/pr/former-border-patrol-agent-pleads-guilty-civil-rights-violations\" rel=\"\"><u>statement</u></a>.

His death was confirmed by his manager, Kim Barry of Jaffrey Management, and his husband, Tony. “Hello everyone. This is Tony, Simon’s husband,” he wrote on Facebook Sunday. “I have some very sad news. At 2:50 this afternoon Simon passed away.” Barry told the<i> New York Post</i> in a statement: “Today I lost not only a client in Simon Fisher-Becker, but a close personal friend of 15 years standing. I shall never forget the phone call I made to him when he was offered the part of Dorium Moldovar in BBC’s <i>Doctor Who</i>.” She said that Fisher-Becker was also a “writer, a raconteur and a great public speaker.” A cause of death was not mentioned by either his husband or manager. “He helped me out enormously and was kind, gracious and interested in everyone,” Barry added. Fisher-Becker played the Fat Friar ghost in <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i> in 2001. He also played Dorium Moldovar in <i>Doctor Who</i> for two seasons, before later reprising the role in the podcast series Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles and Jenny—The Doctor’s Daughter.","type":"text"}],"subheadlines":{"basic":"Simon Fisher-Becker played the Fat Friar ghost in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in 2001."}},{"_id":"VQ5RKU4Z7VA65LH7FV5WBTYLWQ","canonical_website":"thedailybeast","copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-03-10T15:10:06.322Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"OXC6CUNAWZJ5LALTKZ3AVUOCYQ","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Sean Craig","org":null,"image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/7026a2b2-3953-450c-af31-00e4c1195fe9.png","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"b16925a73b135b3ac3c17642a404304d753fd5be9e7a4762dce1a4b6331b35a5"}},"description":"","slug":"sean-craig","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com"},{"site":"facebook","url":null},{"site":"linkedin","url":null}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"facebook","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"linkedin","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"OXC6CUNAWZJ5LALTKZ3AVUOCYQ","type":"author","version":"0.10.10","slug":"sean-craig","byline":"Sean Craig","firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Craig","image":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/7026a2b2-3953-450c-af31-00e4c1195fe9.png","expertise":null,"location":null,"role":null,"email":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com","facebook":null,"bio":"","longBio":"<p>Sean Craig is a reporter in Berlin.

The mural covers a two-block-long pedestrian stretch of 16th Street NW in downtown Washington with the letters of the iconic social justice movement’s name painted in 35-foot-tall letters. Clyde’s legislation also calls on the city to rename the two blocks to Liberty Plaza from Black Lives Matter Plaza. The mural was drawn by D.C. Department of Public Works staff in June 2020, during the nationwide <a href=\"https://thedailybeast.com/keyword/george-floyd-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"https://thedailybeast.com/keyword/george-floyd-protests\">protests</a> that followed the murder of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/george-floyd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/george-floyd/\">George Floyd</a> by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent.” He added that some countries looking at China and the U.S. under Trump will “find China a more attractive partner.” Shortly after the interview, Trump attacked Turnbull—who led Australia for part of Trump’s first term between 2015 and 2018—on his Truth Social platform. “Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from ‘behind,’ never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Trump thundered. “I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian’s agreed with me!!!” ","type":"text"},{"_id":"XELQGBSMJBE3HG4MWEZXTCOLIQ","embed":{"config":{"caption":"","videoCode":"<script src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/22FJNCIw-AjIcq1uW.js\"><\/script>"},"id":"custom_powerup_1741599171085","url":"/"},"subtype":"videoplayer","type":"custom_embed"},{"_id":"46P25EGKANE2FCMQAGW7EBZTYI","additional_properties":{},"content":"","type":"text"}],"subheadlines":{"basic":"The U.S. president responded furiously after he was accused of being “rude and abusive.”"}},{"_id":"VPK45ZJUAZBLPJRCA2QWQORCNA","canonical_website":"thedailybeast","copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-03-10T13:35:59.616Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"nandikachatterjee","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Nandika Chatterjee","image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/9a79ff96-74a2-458d-8848-1483811edbbe.jpg","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"21923069b2c493564040988f90edb53e1c4521f97fb540ba41efa54744464f56"}},"description":"","url":"","slug":"nandika-chatterjee","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"nandika.chatterjee@thedailybeast.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"nandika.chatterjee@thedailybeast.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"nandikachatterjee","firstName":"Nandika","lastName":"Chatterjee","byline":"Nandika Chatterjee","role":"Breaking News Intern","image":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/9a79ff96-74a2-458d-8848-1483811edbbe.jpg","email":"nandika.chatterjee@thedailybeast.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"","longBio":"","slug":"nandika-chatterjee","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2025-02-04T15:06:43.647Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2025-03-10T13:55:43.689Z","first_publish_date":"2025-03-10T13:55:43.689Z","headlines":{"basic":"Lyle and Erik Menendez’s Uncle Who Opposed Their Release Dies at 91","mobile":"Lyle and Erik Menendez’s Uncle Who Opposed Their Release Dies at 91","native":"","print":"","table":"","tablet":"","web":"Uncle of Menendez Brothers, Who Opposed Their Release, Dies"},"label":{"editor":{"display":true,"text":"Mat Murphy","url":""},"read_it_at_label":{"display":true,"text":"TikTok"},"read_it_at_url":{"display":true,"text":"https://www.tiktok.com/@anamariabaralt/video/7479976252644855071"},"rubric":{"display":true,"text":"R.I.P."}},"last_updated_date":"2025-03-10T13:55:43.991Z","promo_items":{"1_1":{"_id":"FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI.jpg?auth=23b302635d864743f6e64a65281f2896296c1ce7abe3cdac901cd5622953ca72","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_job_identifier":"776214203","iptc_source":"Sygma","iptc_title":"Contributor","keywords":["american:cb1","los angeles:cb2","lyle menendez:cb1","march 1994:cb1","medium group of people:cb2","men:cb1","murder:cb2","the court of justice:cb1"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"GettyImages-539886710.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/v2/FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI.jpg?auth=23b302635d864743f6e64a65281f2896296c1ce7abe3cdac901cd5622953ca72","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI.jpg?auth=23b302635d864743f6e64a65281f2896296c1ce7abe3cdac901cd5622953ca72","restricted":false,"takenOn":"1994-03-09T00:00:00Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/FEXWQXAXBRE4XO2EBCVCQ3VWMI.jpg?auth=23b302635d864743f6e64a65281f2896296c1ce7abe3cdac901cd5622953ca72&width=300","usage_instructions":"Not Released (NR) This content may not be materially modified or used in composite content.

This is following an <a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/charles-andersen-obituary?id=57720037\" rel=\"\"><u>obituary</u></a> that was shared by the Thompson &amp; Kuenster Funeral Home in Illinois on March 4. While the brothers’ cousin is in favor of their release, Baralt told fans that no one should rejoice that Andersen had passed. She said that she felt “great empathy” for the boys’ uncle who lost his sister Kitty Menendez in 1989 alongside her husband Jose Menendez, at the hands of the brothers. Andersen was the last of the living relatives who was advocating for Lyle and Erik Menendez to remain imprisoned. The boys’ uncle recently spoke against their release through his attorney Kathy Cady in 2024. Although the rest of the Menendez brothers’ family believe that they killed their parents because their father sexually molested them, Andersen maintained their reasons were motivated by greed. He wasn’t always alone in his assertion. Andersen’s late brother Brian joined him in testifying against their nephews in the death penalty phase of their murder trial in 1996.

The Duchess of Sussex included a photo of Prince Harry cradling the young Princess Lilibet on a boat in a carousel of images for International Women’s Day. At first glance, a viewer may find nothing amiss with the wholesome scene, but critics online quickly pointed out that Princess Lilibet was not wearing a safety vest. “Prince Harry &amp; Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents What f---ing moron doesn’t put their child in a safety vest while boating,” one person wrote. Another added, “Family has been in the boating industry for four generations; a very big no no! Things happen in a blink of an eye.” Yet another commenter called the couple “irresponsible,” adding that “even pet owners put life vests on their pets when riding in boats.” ","type":"text"},{"type":"oembed_response","subtype":"instagram","_id":"PZP7OPMLC5BG5AKUBM5AYNURNA","raw_oembed":{"version":"1.0","author_name":"meghan","provider_name":"Instagram","provider_url":"https://www.instagram.com/","type":"instagram","width":658,"html":"<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DG8m9uIvYqv/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

title=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/amazon/\">Amazon</a> MGM Studios acquired creative control over the legendary franchise. The Irishman, one of only two non-Brits to play <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/james-bond/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/james-bond/\">Bond</a>, spoke to <i>The Telegraph</i> amid speculation about who English actor Daniel Craig’s successor might be. Brosnan, who played Bond in four films between 1995 and 2002, said it’s a “given” that the new 007 should be British, after a flurry of American actors were tipped for the role. Among the names are American-British star Andrew Garfield, Oscar Isaac and Chilean-American Pedro Pascal. However, plenty of British names are in the hat, too. Long-time front-runner Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James of <i>The Gentlemen</i> and former Superman Henry Cavill are also among the favorites. “I hope that [Amazon] handles the work and the character with dignity and imagination and respect,” the <i>GoldenEye</i> and <i>Die Another Day</i> star, 71, said. The veteran actor also commended the “great courage” of longtime Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson to let go of creative control. They will, however, remain co-owners of the franchise. Brosnan recently told <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/exclusive-pierce-brosnan-goes-gangster-in-mobland\" rel=\"\"><i><u>GQ</u></i></a> that “of course” he’d be interested in reprising the role.

Speaking to a Liberal Party gathering after the party elected Mark Carney as its new leader, Chrétien said he was “too old” to set Trump’s new home alight, reflecting on the more than 200-year-old conflict as a reminder of how the country defended itself against U.S. intervention. “During the war of 1812, American troops came to what is now Canada on a mission of conquest,” Chrétien said in his speech, which he described as a “little history lesson” to Trump. “Some [Canadian soldiers] apparently burned down the White House at that time,” he added, earning laughs from the crowd. “But I’m too old to do it... it’s a joke,” he quickly noted. The statement comes as Trump continues to escalate his trade war on America’s northern neighbor, imposing tariffs and threatening to annex Canada and make it the “51st state.”","type":"text"},{"type":"oembed_response","subtype":"twitter","_id":"DIYROMHBUVF7ZPYKJTYBLLOYUI","raw_oembed":{"url":"https://twitter.com/cspotweet/status/1898860385442357276","author_name":"Courtney

The jets intercepted the aircraft and fired flares to warn its pilots to shift course and move away from the restricted flight area. A statement from NORAD indicated that the aircraft flew over the area at around 1:15 p.m. EDT on Sunday, and was ultimately safely escorted out of the zone with no consequential effects. NORAD additionally noted that is the second time an aircraft was intercepted near Mar-a-Lago over the past 48 hours. “Since the January 20, 2025 presidential inauguration, NORAD has responded to over 20 tracks of interest entering the Palm Beach, Florida TFR [temporary flight restriction] area,” NORAD said in a statement. “Aircrews are reminded to verify all FAA NOTAMs [notice to airmen], especially in the NCR and Mar-a-Lago regions.” According to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/us-news/us-air-force-f-16-fighters-forced-to-intercept-2-aircraft-that-invaded-mar-a-lago-airspace/\" rel=\"\"><i><u>The New York Post</u></i></a>, the two incursions occurred while Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago for the weekend.

Rules</i> star James Kennedy has regrets after posting photos of himself with controversial brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, the far-right duo who were accused of rape and human trafficking in Romania, and remain under investigation in the U.K. and Florida. Kennedy posted from Power Slap 12 at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on Friday alongside the brothers, who have denied the allegations against them. Kennedy posted the apology Saturday and the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14479253/james-kennedy-apology-tate-brothers-las-vegas.html\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14479253/james-kennedy-apology-tate-brothers-las-vegas.html\">photo</a> was no longer visible on the 33-year-old’s profile. “I regret posting a photo with the Tate brothers at an event last night,” Kennedy wrote. “I was unfamiliar with their content and the allegations against them. I only knew them as podcasters that had posted a viral clip about <i>Vanderpump</i>. I have since educated myself and condemn their beliefs. I am sorry to all that I offended.\" Kennedy was arrested for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/james-kennedy-arrested-vanderpump-rules-domestic-violence-1236247282/\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/james-kennedy-arrested-vanderpump-rules-domestic-violence-1236247282/\">misdemeanor domestic violence</a> in December 2024. The Tate brothers, meanwhile, face accusations of creating a trafficking group, which duped seven women who were allegedly trafficked to Romania, where they were sexually and physically abused. They were detained in the eastern European country in 2022, but released last month. They recently fled to Florida after dramatic and controversial intervention by the Trump administration, but Florida authorities have since announced their own criminal investigation into the brothers.","type":"text"},{"_id":"K2466SWWMNHNZEKPR4FM3XM64A","additional_properties":{},"content":"","type":"text"},{"_id":"H7HACMYIVBB7DGOUBVLEPH6KZA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/H7HACMYIVBB7DGOUBVLEPH6KZA.png?auth=d838ea10f70535b8223a53c3a433d10367472c0d87b8ed7951bd0d58066dbeac","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"Screenshot
