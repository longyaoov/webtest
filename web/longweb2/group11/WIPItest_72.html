Ron Strang lost most of his left thigh to a roadside bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2010 and he wondered if he would ever be able to walk normally again. But the sergeant was recruited for a new medical technique
                                        using a substance called extracellular matrix, the natural scaffolding that underlies all tissues and organs in both animals and humans. Doctors grafted a thin sheet of material, culled from a pig, on to remaining
                                        healthy muscle in Sergeant Strang&#x2019;s thigh. It helped his thigh to repair and regrow. </p>
