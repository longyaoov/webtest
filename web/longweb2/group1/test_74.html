<p><img src="../images/gold_star.gif" alt="Best Financial Markets Analysis Article" width="80" height="78" align="right" />The Global Warming Scam may finally  be on its way to well-deserved oblivion. Take your pick of discrediting events,  the snow storms that hit the Midwestern U.S., snow at the start of the  Australian Summer, -40 degree temps in Western Canada,&nbsp; or Climategate. The Global Warming Scam  appears now to have been nothing more than a giant research dollar Ponzi-like  scheme.</p>

<p>Researchers would take research dollars, cook some numbers, discard  other data, and exchange dubious research for more funding from other sources.  Rather than useful research that might help us understand what effect  tomorrow&rsquo;s climate might have on global Agri-Food production, we got subterfuge  and intimidation of nonbelievers. </p>
<p>Across the Midwestern U.S. snow  storms have wreaked havoc with the corn harvest. Iowa was hit with the worst  snow storm since the 1950s. Estimates of that corn remaining in the U.S.  fields, now awaiting Spring to be harvested, varies from 6% to 25% to 40%, depending  on location. Estimated losses of that corn remaining in the field till Spring  range from 25% to 40%. Thus far this situation has not caused stress on  Agri-Food prices as the new U.S. corn crop was indeed large, and had just  arrived. </p>
<p>However, as Spring unfolds, we will  know more fully how much of the U.S. corn crop has been damaged. A  fair bet would be that the real economic U.S. corn crop, including the light  weight of the harvested crop and that not already damaged by wet conditions or  lost due to still being in the field, will be a lot less than the forecast  numbers suggest. The  real economic value of corn is not the volume in bushels, but the usable food  content of the corn. And do remember, corn is not produced in a  factory. A new crop of corn will not arrive in North America till Fall of 2010. </p>



<div></div>






<p><img src="../images/2009/Dec/vegitable-oils-14.gif" width="753" height="600" /></p>
<p>One of the many uses of grains like  corn is portrayed in the chart above. Plotted in that chart is months of  vegetable oil consumption, or usage, represented by stocks at the end of the  relevant crop year. Vegetable oil is a critical component of Agri-Food  consumption. As is readily apparent in that graph the world&rsquo;s inventory of  vegetable oil, in terms of months of consumption, has been declining for years.  <span class="style1">The USDA forecasts that the world is  moving toward having less than one month of vegetable oil in inventory. </span>As that is somewhat of an average, some parts  of the world have less than one month of vegetable oil available. Largest  components of global vegetable oil production are palm oil at 33%, and soybean  of about 27%.</p>
<p>While not suggesting that we start  hoarding vegetable oil, not much would be required to push the world toward  such a situation. Vegetable oil is produced by crushing grain, or palm fruit in  the case of palm oil. Since some basic working inventory is required to &ldquo;oil&rdquo;  the supply system, the current low level of inventories would suggest that  inventory building may be necessary. <span class="success">In order to build more inventories, producers would have to  crush more grain or palm fruits. Oil producers would have to bid against others  for grain in an already tight Agri-Food supply world. Some in the world will  pay higher prices for their vegetable oil, while others reap the benefits of  those higher prices.</span></p>









<p><img src="../images/2009/Dec/agri-foods-14.gif" width="820" height="724" /></p>
<p>As shown in our second chart, above,  some companies have indeed been benefitting from the new world of Agri-Food.  These results were accomplished without shortages, but simply because demand  continues to expand. And we add, vegetable oil will not be the only Agri-Food  component that will be in short supply in the years ahead. The sample of  Agri-Food companies, as shown in the graph, have had a bountiful year in 2009.  While the next year will likely not be as good, the future for these companies  should be rewarding.</p>
<p>Over the coming decade the global  population will expand faster than the world&rsquo;s ability to feed that population. A world short of Agri-Food is more likely than  any time in a century. Investors might be well served to begin exploring the  future for Agri-Food.
