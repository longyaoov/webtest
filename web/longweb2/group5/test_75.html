In Sunday's 23-21 home loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Eagles did not seem to be at a talent disadvantage, any more than they had the week before in losing 26-23 in overtime at Tennessee.</p><div style="height:0" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><p class="inq-p text-primary  ">What they seemed to be was hard to label – whatever the opposite of opportunistic is, that was it.

Last year you didn't see a lot of that.

Why on earth would an offense struggling for rhythm ignore the run game? Doug Pederson's answer Monday was an Andy Reid-esque bit about falling behind and not being able to run. But the backs had just five carries in the first half. BTW, Giants opponents are averaging 124.4 rushing yards per game this season.

But it never took control the way it should be able to, at the Linc. After the offense couldn't score any points off Nigel Bradham's fumble recovery, Cam Johnston punted to the Minnesota 11, with 9 minutes, 11 seconds remaining. Get a stop, make the Vikings punt, get the ball back at midfield and try again to score the go-ahead touchdown. Except, Minnesota drove 55 yards in 11 plays, facing only one third down before Eagles defenders gathered themselves to force a 52-yard field goal that turned out to be the difference in the game.</p><div style="height:0" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><div class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"><h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9">Who knew?</h3></div><div style="height:0" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><p class="inq-p text-primary  ">That being tied with San Francisco for the league lead in fumbles after five weeks, with 13, would be a problem?</p><div style="height:0" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><div class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"><h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9">Obscure stat</h3></div><div style="height:0" class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><p class="inq-p text-primary  ">The Eagles are 7-2 at MetLife Stadium, in games against the Giants and the Jets.
