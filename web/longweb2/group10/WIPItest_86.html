Johnson is a Columnist and Director of Content Development for the Alabama Media Group/AL.com, the largest news and information site in Alabama. He shares his perspective on issues, people, policies, and trends affecting us all, and challenges lazy thinking. A winner of the 2021 Edward R. Morrow Award for best national podcast (“Unjustifiable, a six-part series co-hosted with Pulitzer Prize winner John Archibald), Roy joined AMG in 2014 as Director, Sports, and later was Editor of Birmingham magazine. The current role in 2016.  His work appears in AMG’s three print publications--The Birmingham News, Huntsville Times, and Mobile Press-Register--and is often published in other Advance Local publications nationwide. Prior to joining AMG, Roy’s journalistic journey spanned magazines, television, and newspapers, and reached some of the industry’s highest levels. He served as Editor-in-Chief of three prominent national magazines: Savoy (which he conceived and founded), Men’s Fitness, and History Channel. He was also a writer and top editor at Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, was a reporter for The New York Times and sports columnist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Roy was Executive Producer of the “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search” (NBC) and the “Bernie and Ernie” documentary (ESPN). He’s also featured in “The Last Dance”, the much-touted documentary on NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan’s final season. He co-authored books with Earvin (Magic) Johnson (“Magic’s Touch”), Charles Barkley (“Outrageous”), and Avery Johnson (“Aspire Higher”).  A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Roy’s family owned a business on Greenwood Ave, the heart of “Black Wall Street”, and his father was a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.

Johnson is a Columnist and Director of Content Development for the Alabama Media Group/AL.com, the largest news and information site in Alabama. He shares his perspective on issues, people, policies, and trends affecting us all, and challenges lazy thinking. A winner of the 2021 Edward R. Morrow Award for best national podcast (“Unjustifiable, a six-part series co-hosted with Pulitzer Prize winner John Archibald), Roy joined AMG in 2014 as Director, Sports, and later was Editor of Birmingham magazine. The current role in 2016.  His work appears in AMG’s three print publications--The Birmingham News, Huntsville Times, and Mobile Press-Register--and is often published in other Advance Local publications nationwide. Prior to joining AMG, Roy’s journalistic journey spanned magazines, television, and newspapers, and reached some of the industry’s highest levels. He served as Editor-in-Chief of three prominent national magazines: Savoy (which he conceived and founded), Men’s Fitness, and History Channel. He was also a writer and top editor at Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, was a reporter for The New York Times and sports columnist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Roy was Executive Producer of the “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search” (NBC) and the “Bernie and Ernie” documentary (ESPN). He’s also featured in “The Last Dance”, the much-touted documentary on NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan’s final season. He co-authored books with Earvin (Magic) Johnson (“Magic’s Touch”), Charles Barkley (“Outrageous”), and Avery Johnson (“Aspire Higher”).  A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Roy’s family owned a business on Greenwood Ave, the heart of “Black Wall Street”, and his father was a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.

She began her journalism career at The Birmingham News in 1986, and has covered numerous beats including county government, business, education and general assignment reporting. In 1996, she became the lead crime reporter, focusing not only on the initial crimes, but also giving a voice to victims and their families in the aftermath of those crimes. She has won numerous state and regional awards for her crime reporting and feature writing, including  the 2020 Sigma Delta Chi Awards for excellence in journalism for stories she wrote about the 2020 shooting death of 8-year-old Royta Giles at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, and a Green Eyeshade Award for her coverage of the abduction of Kamille “Cupcake” McKinney, a 3-year-old Birmingham girl who was found murdered 10 days after she disappeared from a birthday party, and Alabama Press Association Story of the Year for the story on three people killed in 2014 -- including the gunman -- after a shooting at a UPS facility in Birmingham.\nShe is a graduate of Vestavia Hills High School and Auburn University. She has one daughter and two grandchildren. \n"}}}]},"distributor":{"additional_properties":{},"mode":"custom"},"height":1334,"licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"advancelocal","sponsored":false},"source":{"additional_properties":{},"edit_url":"","system":"Anglerfish"},"subtitle":"Erron Martez Dequan Brown","taxonomy":{"additional_properties":{},"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/45L465RN4RHS5NIDNFQVXT7LQ4.jpeg","version":"0.10.9","width":750,"photographerReference":[{"_id":"thisiscarol","status":true,"bio":"I am a lead Public Safety Reporter for Alabama Media Group, covering crime and law enforcement in Jefferson, Shelby and surrounding counties.

Johnson is a Columnist and Director of Content Development for the Alabama Media Group/AL.com, the largest news and information site in Alabama. He shares his perspective on issues, people, policies, and trends affecting us all, and challenges lazy thinking. A winner of the 2021 Edward R. Morrow Award for best national podcast (“Unjustifiable, a six-part series co-hosted with Pulitzer Prize winner John Archibald), Roy joined AMG in 2014 as Director, Sports, and later was Editor of Birmingham magazine. The current role in 2016.  His work appears in AMG’s three print publications--The Birmingham News, Huntsville Times, and Mobile Press-Register--and is often published in other Advance Local publications nationwide. Prior to joining AMG, Roy’s journalistic journey spanned magazines, television, and newspapers, and reached some of the industry’s highest levels. He served as Editor-in-Chief of three prominent national magazines: Savoy (which he conceived and founded), Men’s Fitness, and History Channel. He was also a writer and top editor at Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, was a reporter for The New York Times and sports columnist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Roy was Executive Producer of the “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search” (NBC) and the “Bernie and Ernie” documentary (ESPN). He’s also featured in “The Last Dance”, the much-touted documentary on NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan’s final season. He co-authored books with Earvin (Magic) Johnson (“Magic’s Touch”), Charles Barkley (“Outrageous”), and Avery Johnson (“Aspire Higher”).

Johnson is a Columnist and Director of Content Development for the Alabama Media Group/AL.com, the largest news and information site in Alabama. He shares his perspective on issues, people, policies, and trends affecting us all, and challenges lazy thinking. A winner of the 2021 Edward R. Morrow Award for best national podcast (“Unjustifiable, a six-part series co-hosted with Pulitzer Prize winner John Archibald), Roy joined AMG in 2014 as Director, Sports, and later was Editor of Birmingham magazine. The current role in 2016.  His work appears in AMG’s three print publications--The Birmingham News, Huntsville Times, and Mobile Press-Register--and is often published in other Advance Local publications nationwide. Prior to joining AMG, Roy’s journalistic journey spanned magazines, television, and newspapers, and reached some of the industry’s highest levels. He served as Editor-in-Chief of three prominent national magazines: Savoy (which he conceived and founded), Men’s Fitness, and History Channel. He was also a writer and top editor at Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, was a reporter for The New York Times and sports columnist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Roy was Executive Producer of the “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search” (NBC) and the “Bernie and Ernie” documentary (ESPN). He’s also featured in “The Last Dance”, the much-touted documentary on NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan’s final season. He co-authored books with Earvin (Magic) Johnson (“Magic’s Touch”), Charles Barkley (“Outrageous”), and Avery Johnson (“Aspire Higher”).  A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Roy’s family owned a business on Greenwood Ave, the heart of “Black Wall Street”, and his father was a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. He is a graduate of Stanford University and lives in Birmingham, Alabama.\n","bio":"A Pulitzer Prize finalist in Commentary, opinion journalist Roy S.

Johnson is a Columnist and Director of Content Development for the Alabama Media Group/AL.com, the largest news and information site in Alabama. He shares his perspective on issues, people, policies, and trends affecting us all, and challenges lazy thinking. A winner of the 2021 Edward R. Morrow Award for best national podcast (“Unjustifiable, a six-part series co-hosted with Pulitzer Prize winner John Archibald), Roy joined AMG in 2014 as Director, Sports, and later was Editor of Birmingham magazine. The current role in 2016.  His work appears in AMG’s three print publications--The Birmingham News, Huntsville Times, and Mobile Press-Register--and is often published in other Advance Local publications nationwide. Prior to joining AMG, Roy’s journalistic journey spanned magazines, television, and newspapers, and reached some of the industry’s highest levels. He served as Editor-in-Chief of three prominent national magazines: Savoy (which he conceived and founded), Men’s Fitness, and History Channel. He was also a writer and top editor at Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, was a reporter for The New York Times and sports columnist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Roy was Executive Producer of the “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search” (NBC) and the “Bernie and Ernie” documentary (ESPN). He’s also featured in “The Last Dance”, the much-touted documentary on NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan’s final season. He co-authored books with Earvin (Magic) Johnson (“Magic’s Touch”), Charles Barkley (“Outrageous”), and Avery Johnson (“Aspire Higher”).  A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Roy’s family owned a business on Greenwood Ave, the heart of “Black Wall Street”, and his father was a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. He is a graduate of Stanford University and lives in Birmingham, Alabama.\n","bio":"A Pulitzer Prize finalist in Commentary, opinion journalist Roy S.
