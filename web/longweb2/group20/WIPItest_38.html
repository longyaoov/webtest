                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now, having absorbed the painful lessons of the hyper-magnified (and context-removed) political blunder, Mr. Romney is turning the tables on <a href="https://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?8qa">President Obama</a>.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For the fifth day in a row, the Romney campaign assailed Mr. Obama on Tuesday over remarks that it said revealed his disconnect from economic reality, a theme that began on Friday after the president declared that the
                                        &#x201C;private sector is doing fine&#x201D; and shows no signs of letting up.</p>

                                        so, this particular company probably wouldn&#x2019;t have been impacted by that.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A gaffe? Mr. Romney treated it that way, and in his speech at a factory that makes air filters, he called the statement &#x201C;something else that shows just how much out of touch&#x201D; the president is.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Romney cited an online <a href="https://www.uschambersmallbusinessnation.com/docs/US-Chamber-of-Commerce-Summit-Presentation-from-Harris-Interactive.pdf">survey</a> of almost 1,500 small-business owners, performed

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Romney campaign has a simple message these days, which it is repeating over and over: what it portrays as President Obama&#x2019;s &#x201C;mistakes&#x201D; are not mistakes at all. Instead, they are windows into
                                        the mind of a man detached from the problems of ordinary Americans and small businesses.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is a striking line of attack that seeks to repurpose and reverse the thrust of Mr. Obama&#x2019;s central critique of Mr. Romney: that he is a rapacious corporate raider unfamiliar with the problems of regular Americans.</p>

And at a fund-raiser in Owings Mills, Md., on Tuesday, Mr. Obama, who plans to give an address on the economy on Thursday, chided his opponent for his
                                        barrage of recent attacks.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Because folks are still hurting right now, the other side feels that it&#x2019;s enough for them to just sit back and say things aren&#x2019;t as good as they should be, and it&#x2019;s Obama&#x2019;s fault,&#x201D;
                                        the president said. &#x201C;I mean, you can pretty much put their campaign on a tweet and have some characters to spare.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The president&#x2019;s campaign staff said it welcomed a debate over which candidate is more out of touch, especially given Mr. Romney&#x2019;s rhetorical record during the primary. But that is not deterring Mr. Romney.
                                        On Tuesday morning, he appeared on &#x201C;Fox and Friends,&#x201D; where he said the president was &#x201C;really out of touch with what is happening across America.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The president needs to go out and talk to people, not just do fund-raisers, go out and talk to people in the country and find out what is happening,&#x201D; Mr. Romney said.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That criticism appears to be seeping in. At the event here, Frank Attkisson, a small-business consultant and local commissioner, nodded in agreement with Mr. Romney during the speech, and afterward said the president&#x2019;s
