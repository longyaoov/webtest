            <h3>Transformation scenarios</h3>
            <p class="p">A transformation scenario is like a macro which enables you
               to run an XML file quickly through an XSLT transformation,
               save the resulting output, and then view it in an appropriate
               program such as a browser. So in a transformation scenario,
               you specify:        
               
               <ul>
                  <li class="item">An input file (this is optional)</li>
                  <li class="item">An XSLT file</li>
                  <li class="item">An XSLT engine to do the work</li>
                  <li class="item">An output file pattern</li>
                  <li class="item">An action to take when the transformation is complete
                     (such as opening the result in a browser)
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="p">In this case, oXygen has some built-in transformation
               	scenarios we can use to process our ODD customization file.
               	These scenarios are already set up with the XSLT file, XSLT
               	engine, output, and action. So all we need to do is to
               	associate the desired scenario(s) with the ODD customization
               	file, and then tell oXygen to execute the associated
               	scenarios.
            </p>

            <h3>Generating ODD output</h3>
            <ol>
               <li class="item">Open your ODD file in oXygen; make it the front tab</li>
               <li class="item">Press <span class="name_cmd">⌘-⇧-c</span>
                  	  (<span class="name_cmd">⎈-⇧-c</span> on Windows or
                  	  GNU/Linux) or click on the “Configure Transformation
                  	  Scenario(s)” button in the toolbar to set up the
                  	  transformation scenario for your ODD file.
                  
                  <div xmlns:in="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" class="figure"><img src="../../_utils/gfx/trans_scen_ox_14_01.png" style="width: 332px; height: 56px; " title="oXygen toolbar with mouse hovering over configure&#xA;            transformation scenario button" alt="oXygen toolbar with mouse hovering over configure&#xA;            transformation scenario button" /></div>
               </li>
               <li class="item">You’ll get the <span class="title">Configure Transformation
                     Scenario(s)</span> dialog box, showing the transformation
                  scenarios that are readily available. At the top of the box is
                  a text-entry field for filtering the scenarios shown in the
                  main list. Enter <span class="q">tei odd</span>:

               <li class="item">Leave the “Association follows selection” button
                  	unchecked, and click on the box associated with each of the
                  	desired transformations. This will usually be:
                  	
                  <ul>
                     <li class="item">Schematron, ISO</li>

               </li>
               <li class="item">Click on <span class="name_cmd">Apply associated</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p class="p">All the transformations you selected will be run on the ODD
               file currently being edited. Several output windows will pop up
               in the lower part of the oXygen window, and XHTML (if any) will
               be opened in a browser. RELAX NG output will be saved into a
               subdirectory called <span class="name_path">out/</span>. All this may
               take a minute or two.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Hereafter you can run the selected scenarios on the ODD file
               currently being edited by pressing <span class="name_cmd">⌘-⇧-t</span> (<span class="name_cmd">⎈-⇧-t</span> on Windows or GNU/Linux)
               or clicking on the “Apply Transformation Scenario(s)” button (a
               red triangle in a circle).
