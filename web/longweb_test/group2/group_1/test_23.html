                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sometimes it is a twin rotor Chinook or other helicopter transporter, passing high above the Houses of Parliament.

                                        &#x2013; the rainbow-flagged collection of mountain tents and anti-war banners known as the Democracy Village.<br>

                                        Commons and House of Lords in one of the capital&#x2019;s most venerable public spaces, otherwise occupied by statues of past British Prime Ministers including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and Lord Palmerston.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One can only imagine what each of these men &#x2013; from eras of earlier Anglo-Afghan or Mesopotamian wars &#x2013; would make of the dreadlocked, tee-shirted protesters who are now the closest neighbors to the newly-elected
                                        Conservative-led British coalition government.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To some the site is an eyesore. To others it is a rallying point for British antiwar sentiment.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Anna Chithrakala, a 30-year-old Londoner who describes herself as a &#x201C;peace promoter,&#x201D; conceded Wednesday that it receives &#x201C;an equal amount of negative reaction and positive reaction,&#x201D; including
                                        passing drivers who shout &#x201C;parasites.&#x201D; Even as she did so a cycle courier sped past, shouting, &#x201C;Go, peace.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, many in the camp were entirely unaware that even as they protested, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/world/europe/10britain.html">Gen. David H. Petraeus and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had passed through London</a>                                        en route to NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Mr. Gates is expected to urge contributing nations to overcome domestic opposition to the Afghan war, and offer more forces to train Afghanistan&#x2019;s soldiers
                                        and police.</p>
                                    <hr>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Democracy Village was set up in the closing days of the recent British parliamentary election, its stated aim being to influence the new coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservative
                                        Party, and his Liberal Democrat deputy, Nick Clegg.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The tented camp is unlikely to last very long, if the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London succeed in their goal of evicting its occupants. But in the meantime it has attracted an eclectic collection of demonstrators,
                                        including anarchists, anti-capitalists, those protesting against perceived injustices from Sri Lanka to Gaza, environmental activists and others convinced that there is a conspiracy to conceal the truth behind the
                                        9/11 aircraft hijackings.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However among visitors, full-time residents and sympathizers alike there is unanimity that the Afghan and Iraq wars should end, under the banners &#x201C;No More War&#x201D; and &#x201C;Soldiers, Come Home Alive&#x201D;.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Colin Bex, a 70-year-old former architect, went so far as to stand against Mr. Cameron in the May 6 election, under the banner of the Wessex Regionalists party, which he co-founded.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He expects little more from the new administration than from its predecessors led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the most prominent figures in the Labour government that took Britain into both the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Do I think they will pull the troops out? Absolutely not,&#x201D; said Mr. Bex, who opposes the wars on both moral and pragmatic grounds. However, he paused, and then qualified his initial certainty. &#x201C;The
                                        only thing that they may do is pull out if the economy demands it, if they find that they can save 2 billion pounds or 10 billion pounds. I am sure there would be no moral aspect whatsoever. It&#x2019;s all politics,
                                        at the dirtiest level.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sitting in a collapsible chair some days earlier Sam Fryers, 25, a former soldier turned opponent of the Iraq and Afghan wars, said his change of heart was motivated in part by what he had seen during his own service.
                                        &#x201C;I have seen guys out there breaking down and in tears,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They hadn&#x2019;t received adequate training to deal with that kind of invasion.&#x201D; He also believed the wars were illegal
                                        and immoral, saying that while he acknowledged there was &#x201C;an element of terrorism&#x201D; with the Taliban, he sympathized with Afghans who said they were only defending their country against armed foreign
                                        invaders.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;This is not our war. That is why we are here. I don&#x2019;t want to see any more of those guys getting killed, and I don&#x2019;t want to see any more Afghans getting killed.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Chithrakala, the &#x2018;peace promoter,&#x2019; cited another &#x2013; albeit far more brief &#x2013; encounter with the military to explain her opposition to the conflict.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A man who claimed to be a British serviceman had come to the camp three weeks ago, she said, ostensibly to hear what they had to say. The exchange between military and antiwar camps led to rancor and an encounter, she
                                        said, which culminated in him defending the work of NATO troops in Afghanistan.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;He was really shouting and said, &#x2018;What about the Afghan women, who is going to liberate them if we leave?&#x2019; He was very aggressive and I thought he was going to hit me. I said, &#x2018;I feel oppressed
                                        by you right now, how can you bring liberty to Afghan women?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Chithrakala said her own opposition was based on deep skepticism over the reasons offered by governments in Washington and London for going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It was all just a piece of theater, the reasons they gave us didn&#x2019;t mean anything,&#x201D; she said, sharing an analysis of many at the camp, that Western governments were intent on controlling the region
                                        and its natural resources.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I think they are probably going to try and get more control of Iran. It&#x2019;s a very rich and resource-filled area, so it&#x2019;s very important for them to keep us there.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;And I think the reasons that we were given were to terrify us enough &#x2013; weapons of mass destruction, terrorists. All of this stuff, it is just there to scare us enough that we don&#x2019;t question it,
                                        so we think &#x2018;if we don&#x2019;t go in then a terrorist organization is going to come and bomb me and my family.&#x2019; But we are going in and doing that same thing to families there, so we are just perpetrating
                                        that fear, but it&#x2019;s not achieving anything positive.&#x201D;</p>
