A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, The Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and Jane Fonda. I have been the AJC's \"American Idol\" expert since 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and all sorts of live events. I have an adorable adopted daughter Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcGAentertainment/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtitle":"","width":400,"first_publish_date":"2014-11-06T17:41:53Z","_id":"KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c","keywords":["radiotvtalk blog","radiotvtalk"],"proxyUrl":"/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c","takenOn":"2014-11-06T17:41:53Z","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c&width=300","version":0,"originalName":"https://www.ajc.com//rw/Pub/p5/AJC/2014/11/06/Images/WPIMAGE_cmgajcradiotvtalk_12693.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","restricted":false,"galleries":[],"_id":"D7OXTDYEUBF4BHSZLVPJFWMWII"},"created_date":"2020-06-20T03:46:05Z","last_updated_date":"2020-06-20T03:46:05Z","publish_date":"2014-11-06T17:41:53Z","height":533,"resized_obj":{"0":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c&width=600&height=400&smart=true"},"1":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c&width=600&height=400&smart=true"},"2":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/KCA2VSFALFZKL3NECXITLOPJRU.jpg?auth=23edefbde48030a19b76cc1ce6c108f312e39036c71847f506285e6f14781b4c&width=500&height=500&smart=true"}}},{"_id":"E3DYQP34UJAG3JWXO42KACGDPE","additional_properties":{"_id":1741301344722},"type":"text","content":"Scores of others have made impressions.
