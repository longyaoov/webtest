However, I&#8217;m sure they saved some punches for today. Here&#8217;s our live coverage from Moscone, with analysis and hands-on articles:</p> <h4><a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-well-wear-watches-again-5801065">Why We&#8217;ll Wear Watches Again</a></h4> <p>For most people, the only reason to wear a watch anymore is to tell other people that you are the kind of person that still wears a watch.
