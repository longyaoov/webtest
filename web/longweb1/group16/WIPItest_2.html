The endangered Yuma clapper rail croaks a funny song in the tall reeds that rise up out of the unexpected marshes in the Ci&eacute;nega de Santa Clara. The snowy egret, vermilion flycatcher and Gila woodpecker are surging back in the Laguna Grande wetlands and the endangered yellow-billed cuckoo is found anew at this key stopover on the Pacific migratory bird flyway. Lured by water and habitat fix-ups through binational restoration efforts, bobcats and beavers are making a comeback, too. &nbsp;</p><p class="" data-block="sciam/paragraph">These wetlands, to be clear, are south of the border line and may not be directly affected by any future border wall. But like other natural resources along the border whose health and well-being rests in a commitment to cross-border conservation, such as Big Bend National Park in Texas or the Sky Islands of Arizona and New Mexico, they are part of connected ecosystems already challenged by encroaching urbanization, increasing water demand and climate change.</p><p class="" data-block="sciam/paragraph">The &ldquo;migrant caravan&rdquo; that has been dominating the news lately reminds us that human life is at stake at the border&mdash;and so is the health of entire ecosystems we humans depend on. Scientists are united in their assessment that a 30-foot high solid wall across the nearly 2,000-mile expanse of the border, along with the new lighting, roads and Border Patrol base camps that would accompany it, would threaten land and plant life as well as animals in this fragile and biodiverse place. It would threaten public lands that have protected status. And most important, it would fail to deter migrants fleeing violence and seeking security.</p><hr/><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you&#x27;re enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

The two nations&rsquo; willingness to cooperate has grown in the last three decades as western states in both countries struggle with climate change, drought and growing water demand.</p><p class="" data-block="sciam/paragraph">One success of this cooperation was the release of a one-time &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; of water on March 23, 2014. For the first time in anyone&rsquo;s living memory, children splashed joyously in the Colorado River as it flowed south from the U.S. into the delta towards the sea at the Gulf of California. Forty-three percent more birds now thrive in the restoration areas, 200,000 trees have been planted, and local people, especially women, are being trained to assist with scientific monitoring.</p><p class="" data-block="sciam/paragraph">In July, over 2,500 scientists from the U.S. and Mexico, including MacArthur award winning biologist Paul Ehrlich, signed a letter published in the peer-reviewed journal<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/10/740/5057517"></a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/10/740/5057517"><i>BioScience</i></a> decrying the waiver of federal and state environmental laws to build the wall, citing its irremediable consequences.
