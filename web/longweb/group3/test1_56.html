								This is certainly an amazing gift. Usually it is a relative who does this.  But, if something happens to her one-good kidney, then what?  She also has 3 children.

								The fear you express in this question is one many people have.  Part of the reason that I hear people asking this question is that folks are really unaware of basic biology.

It&#39;s really uncommon for something to happen to &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; kidney.  The most likely thing to have happen to one kidney, is to be born without it.

Donating doesn&#39;t have a mathematically significant impact upon the donor.

								Harry, I am an organ donor but maybe some people have religious objections?  I just hope that people will consider doing it.

								Hopefully there are people who are as generous as she is.

One thing I will never understand.  Why isn&#39;t every person in america an organ donor.  Your dead why would you want to be buried with your organs?

We seem to throw around that word a lot these days.
