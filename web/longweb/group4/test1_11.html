She is a former policy reporter at Georgia Public Broadcasting, which she joined in 2020 to report stories at the intersection of government and daily life.\n\nPrior to GPB, Riley was the Georgia statehouse reporter for CNHI News, where she covered the general assembly, 2020 elections and statewide social issues. Some of her notable work included the lack of access to rural health care, agriculture reform, maternal mortality and care for Georgians with disabilities.
