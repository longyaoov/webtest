                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
                                            This year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which
                                            allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood&#x2019;s residents.</p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The game makes everything transparent,&#x201D; said Pontus Westerberg, a digital projects officer at the program, UN-Habitat. &#x201C;It gives the communities we work with more agency and helps everyone
                                            see what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201D;</p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts &#x2014; known
                                            as serious games &#x2014; once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has
                                            come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.</p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Far removed from the military battles, zombie attacks and alien uprisings that dominate the multibillion-dollar video game industry, Games for Change is focused on lesser-known titles that treat the medium as something
                                            more than entertainment. The organization&#x2019;s festival has become a platform to introduce video games with altruistic goals. &#x2026;</p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One speaker at this year&#x2019;s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game
                                            Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based
                                            on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game&#x2019;s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players
                                            had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.</p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.

                                            are really not that productive.</p>

                                        <p>I used to play games a lot but i have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees.</p>

                                        <p>I think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There&#x2019;s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your
                                            brain and they make you do bad things.</p>

                                        <p>My favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game.
                                            No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem.</p>

                                        <p>the video games i have played are strategic and would make me think. i have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so i would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one
                                            for my school to invest in.</p>

                                        <p>That&#x2019;s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. i personally have not heard
                                            anything that could help with research.</p>

                                        <p>My favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don&#x2019;t play very many video games and it&#x2019;s fun to just drive around and wander the game.
                                            When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don&#x2019;t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I&#x2019;ve
                                            never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it&#x2019;s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days.</p>

                                        <p>My favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped
                                            with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my
                                            creativity and build things that I&#x2019;ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation
                                            and staring a screen all day isn&#x2019;t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools
                                            could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning.</p>

                                        <p>I used to play Pokemon on Nintendos and now I play games like COD on Xbox. These games have enriched my life with lessons like never giving up or doing what&#x2019;s right. They did teach me a few mental and physical
                                            skills too. I have never played any games like the ones by Games for Change, but I have heard of them and how they change lives. And I do think video games can be effective when it comes to us learning things.
                                            They can change the world because like the ones by Games for Change can help us to learn how to treat and solve diseases, but also they can teach us moral lessons like how we should treat ourselves and each
                                            other with respect. (Something many of us don&#x2019;t have anymore.)</p>

                                        <p>The way i learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. i play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what i like to
                                            do everyday when i get home from school etc. i can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i&#x2019;m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to
                                            throughout all the other assasin creed games. i am such a video game expert i&#x2019;ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. i just love to play video games.</p>

                                        <p>Im a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every
                                            game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my
                                            opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes.</p>

                                        <p>&#x2013; My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2.<br> As someone who lives in germany, where most students don&#x2019;t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about
                                            english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade.</p>
                                        <p>&#x2013; I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I&#x2019;m definitely looking forward to them.</p>
                                        <p>&#x2013; Yes, I think they can, because it is the only digital medium were you engage by yourself. YOU create something in Minecraft and after that, YOU feel good while looking at it. You&#x2019;re proud of what
                                            you&#x2019;re doing and this can motivate you, to do something in the real world. Like building a house after Minecraft, or wanting to learn more about our universe after playing Universe Sandbox. Game Developers
                                            like Valve also show, that you can learn from games and their mechanics like the portals in Portal. <a href="https://www.learnwithportals.com/" rel="nofollow">//www.learnwithportals.com/</a></p>
                                        <p>&#x2013; I don&#x2019;t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn&#x2019;t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people,
                                            probably would.</p>

                                        <p>I play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to
                                            evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think.</p>

                                        <p>&#x2014; What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you &#x2014; whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible?
                                            How have they enriched your life?</p>
                                        <p>my favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing i think they&#x2019;ve taught me&#x2026; that no matter
                                            who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it!</p>
                                        <p>&#x2014; Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is &#x201C;more than entertainment&#x201D;? What did you think of it? What did you learn?</p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately not, i would love to have the chance to be able to though, i believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, i believe that the educational value of video
                                            games are much greater than what people believe.</p>
                                        <p>&#x2014; Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help &#x201C;change the world&#x201D;? Why or why not?</p>
                                        <p>Yes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it&#x2019;s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says &#x201C;lets try to use it like this!&#x201D;
                                            and works hard on that.</p>
                                        <p>&#x2014; If your school were to invest in a &#x201C;video game for change&#x201D; that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like
                                            it to be about? How might it work?</p>
                                        <p>I would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can
                                            honestly say that the lessons spoke to them.</p>

                                        <p>I have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn&#x2019;t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I&#x2019;ve
                                            grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one&#x2019;s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or
                                            choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it&#x2019;s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the choices even within the games.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life.
                                            A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations.</p>

                                        <p>The focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could
                                            make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you
                                            do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas.</p>
