              <p>Figma’s Table Museum series is adding another iconic artistic masterpiece to its collection. Following up on action figure versions of <a href="https://toyland.gizmodo.com/this-action-figure-finally-gives-the-venus-de-milo-her-1715463462">the Venus de Milo</a> and <a href="https://toyland.gizmodo.com/the-only-action-figure-you-can-call-a-genuine-masterpie-1739611295">Michelangelo’s David</a>, there’s now a bizarre <a href="http://www.goodsmile.info/ja/product/5700/figma+%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A6%E3%82%B9%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%93%E5%9B%B3.html#itemZoom3">multi-limbed version of Leondardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man</a> to add to your toy box.</p> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man">original Vitruvian Man sketch</a> appeared in the third book of Roman architect Vitrivius’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Architectura">De Architectura</a> series and is supposed to be an example of what the ideal human body should look like. That, of course, is up for debate, but Figma’s figure does appear to accurately capture every last detail of the sketch. Every&#8230; last&#8230; one&#8230;</p> <p>With eight limbs at his disposal, Vitruvian Man would have no problem besting Michelangelo’s David in a wrestling match. But you’ll be paying a premium for all of those extra arms and legs. The figure is now available for just shy of $60, with an included display stand and da Vinci sketch backdrop.</p><div class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto">
