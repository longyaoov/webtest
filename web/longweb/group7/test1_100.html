Barnes preparing to play golf with President Obama on Sunday in Fort Belvoir, Va.</span></div>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Melody C. Barnes, a White House aide, broke through President Obama&#x2019;s green ceiling Sunday afternoon.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/us/politics/25web-barnes.html">Ms. Barnes</a>, the president&#x2019;s chief domestic policy adviser, became the first woman to play a round of golf with Mr. Obama since he
                                        tee&#x2019;d off his presidency in January. The milestone is noteworthy as Mr. Obama has come under criticism recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/politics/25vibe.html">for hosting a basketball game</a>                                        earlier this month for members of his cabinet and congress that included no women (&#x201C;Bunk,&#x201D; Mr. Obama told NBC in an interview last week when asked about the controversy over the estrogen-free game).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Shortly after 1 p.m. on a crisp and sunny fall afternoon, Mr. Obama and Ms. Barnes took to the links at the U.S Army&#x2019;s Fort Belvoir in Virginia. The president wore a black short-sleeve shirt while Ms. Barnes
                                        donned a baseball cap and a dark long-sleeve shirt, according to a White House pool report prepared by Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The White House spokesman Bill Burton had e-mailed Ms. Sweet that it was &#x201C;not true&#x201D; that Ms. Barnes had been the first woman to golf with Mr. Obama since he became president, although the names of no women
                                        have been listed as the president&#x2019;s companions on his previous 23 rounds since taking office. (CBS&#x2019;s Mark Knoller, who keeps meticulous records of presidential activities &#x2014; including the aforementioned
                                        golf data &#x2014; said that the White House does not always release the name of everyone who golfs with Mr. Obama.)</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But after Ms. Sweet asked who had been the first woman to golf with President Obama, Mr. Burton took a mulligan in a followup e-mail: &#x201C;I was wrong about this &#x2014; all apologies. He golfed with women on the
                                        campaign trail but not until Melody this year. Sorry to all the people who were unwittingly misled by what I gave the pooler.&#x201D;</p>

                                        <p>I think Obama has long since proved his bona fides as a strong feminist.</p>
                                        <p>But does the absurd media coverage the all-male basketball game has received mean that every time Obama moves a muscle, it wlll be scrutinized for politically correctness according to extreme feminists???</p>
                                        <p>Well, I am certainly confident that anyone who considers the all-male basketball game to be serious evidence of Obama&#x2019;s sexism would never condone a bunch of women getting together without a male present
                                            . </p>

                                        <p>I&#x2019;ve always been a tomboy&#x2026;sports fan, more comfortable hanging with the guys. I totally understand the bond amongst men, often centered around beer, sports, cigars (i.e. fun stuff!). It&#x2019;s a
                                            wonderful thing, just like the unique bond amongst women. The problem arises when work and important decisions are made during these all-male activities, whether intentional or not. I don&#x2019;t know what
                                            to say ladies&#x2026;take up golf I suppose.</p>

                                        <p>Unbelievable. This is &#x201C;political correctness&#x201D; without common sense. Dangerous.<br> I am ok if there are baby showers were just women are invited, I am ok if there are sports team only for girls, I
                                            am ok if there are bathrooms only for women, and I am ok if the President chooses to play sports with men. People can read way too much into things, and forget context, common sense, perspective and also a bit
                                            of humor.<br> Relax.

                                        <p>Many times men are establishing relationships that further their careers when they get togther in activites such as these. Decisions are often made in such settings. If the all male club is sustained, women are
                                            put at a disadvantage. The people invited to such events are often the real inner circle. When women are excluded, they are put at a disadvantage.</p>
                                        <p>If HRC had been elected president, how would men like it if she only invited women to all social functions and shut out men? My question is hypothetical since HRC did not win, but it would be interesting to see
                                            men&#x2019;s reactions to such a scenario.</p>
                                        <p>For all of Obama&#x2019;s talk, I do think he harbors sexist attitudes.</p>

                                        <p>From Oxford American Dictionaries:</p>
                                        <p>Thesaurus<br> golf
                                            <br> noun
                                            <br> See note and table.<br> USAGE NOTEgolf<br> One may either play golf (the phrase dates from ca. 1575) or simply golf (ca. 1800)&#x2014;that is, golf can be a verb as well as a noun. Most golfers use the
                                            older phrasing and say that they play golf ( I&#x2019;ll be playing golf on Saturday), whereas nowadays nongolfers tend to be the ones who use golf as a verb ( she&#x2019;ll be golfing on Saturday). In modern
                                            print sources, played golf is 20 times as common as golfed. Writers on golf often disparage the verb golf as symptomatic of linguistic dufferdom&#x2014;e.g.: One writer states: &#x201C;If you call yourself a
                                            golfer, you never use golf as a verb. You never say &#x2018;We went golfing.&#x2019; Golf to a golfer is a noun. A guy tells you he &#x2018;golfs,&#x2019; and you know he&#x2019;s clueless.&#x201D; ( San Francisco
                                            Examiner; June 14, 1998.) If you&#x2019;re serious about golf and writing, stick to the noun uses of golf. That will never get anyone teed off. &#x2014; BG</p>

                                        <p>First of all, obviously the president and his staff seems to have realized that this is a problem. Why else, all of a sudden, Melody Barnes is playing golf with him? </p>
                                        <p>Second, to all those people dismissing this story: it&#x2019;s not &#x201C;just&#x201D; a basketball game. Things like these might seem harmless on the surface, but can actually have a deleterious effect on women&#x2019;s
                                            upward movement in the workplace. It is exactly these kinds of informal, male networks that can give men the edge, when it comes time for performance reviews, bonuses, allocation of juicy assignments, promotions,
                                            etc. </p>
                                        <p>This doesn&#x2019;t mean that men aren&#x2019;t allowed to play basketball anymore. It just means that corporate bosses need to be a lot of more sensitive about organizing after-work activities that are inclusive
                                            of everyone. If that means that you don&#x2019;t play basketball with your office, but with an external community league, so be it. It won&#x2019;t be the end of the world. Being an egalitarian leader means
                                            having to make some sacrifices.</p>

                                        <p>Good for both of them. </p>
                                        <p>We women who golf learned a long time ago that it helps solidify relationships, make men more comfortable off the course, and allows boht players to witness outside the office what we should already know from inside
                                            the office &#x2013; namely, how people behave when things go your way &#x2013; and when they don&#x2019;t. Is it with honesty, humility, humor, and strength? It&#x2019;s a great litmus test for any relationship,
                                            professional and personal. Good for President Obama for opening up the game.</p>

                                        <p>What Obama organized is a text book example of a boys-only club.</p>
                                        <p>This is WRONG. </p>
                                        <p>The president is never &#x201C;off duty,&#x201D; particularly when interacting with his employees.</p>
                                        <p>Every moment of the president&#x2019;s day is scheduled. An opportunity to spend time with him is precious to anyone who wants to have an influence on public policy. That&#x2019;s why some people spend tens &#x2013;
                                            if not hundreds &#x2013; of thousands of dollars to play a round with him. This is Politics 101.</p>
                                        <p>Every nay-saying commenter here acknowledged that these games help the president bond with his staff and other advisors. Bonding with your boss is important. Women deserve an equal opportunity to do this. </p>
                                        <p>If you don&#x2019;t think its a problem that, after 22 golf games and numerous basketball games, NO women &#x2013; until now &#x2013; were given an equal opportunity to get face time and bond with the president,
                                            you are both a sexist and an ignoramus. </p>
                                        <p>And don&#x2019;t fool yourselves &#x2013; if a president Hillary Clinton organized 22+ golf games and a dozen bridge games and didn&#x2019;t invite any male staff, you male reporters and pundits and commenters would
                                            be shrieking with outrage. You&#x2019;d be crying about man-hating and calling for her impeachment. Admit it.</p>
                                        <p>We do NOT need a White House modeled on Mad Men. If that&#x2019;s the change B. has in mind, he can stuff it.</p>
