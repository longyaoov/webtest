          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>Alistair Boettiger is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and is a member of Bio-X and the Biophysics Program. As an undergraduate he studied Physics and Molecular Biology at Princeton University, where he had the opportunity to experience lab research under the mentorship of Stas Shvartsman, who introduced him to his abiding interest in quantitative imaging and animal development. He conducted his Ph.D. research under the guidance of Michael Levine at UC Berkeley, where he studied cis-regulatory sequences that modulate the precision and robustness of gene expression (in particular shadow enhancers and paused promoters). As a postdoc in Xiaowei Zhuang's single-molecule imaging group at Harvard University, he studied gene regulation through super-resolution microscopy, multiplexed, error-correcting imaging, and deep sequencing. Dr. Boettiger started his lab at Stanford in 2016.</p>

          <h3>Current Research and Scholarly Interests</h3>
          <p>My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors.  For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one.  Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors.  The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.   An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other.  The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms, since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome.  By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure, a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes, and achieve different behavioral states.<br /><br />So far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes, or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell.   Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure.  Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent tools for coloring specific regions of DNA and particular DNA-associated proteins with uniquely colored dyes — but lacks the resolution to turn these colored blurs into structures.  Electron-microscopy has substantially greater resolution but lacks compatibility with specific labeling techniques to tell different gene clusters or different protein types apart.  Super-resolution imaging approaches promise to address this balance by allowing the use of fluorescent labels while simultaneously resolving structures on the nano-scale.  I have been adapting this approach to uncover the nano-scale structure of chromatin and determine to how this structure changes when bound by different types of nuclear proteins.  While individual gene clusters appear as quite diverse structures, there appear to be a few general features, for example, linking structure with the epigenetic state.</p>

This EIE sequence is sufficient to enhance MYC expression and is required for cancer cell fitness.

Hypotheses about molecular mechanisms enabling cross-TAD interactions remain to be assessed. To test these hypotheses, we used optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture to characterize the conformations of the Pitx1 locus on single chromosomes in developing mouse limbs. Our data support a model in which neighboring boundaries are stacked as a result of loop extrusion, bringing boundary-proximal cis-elements into contact. This stacking interaction also contributes to the appearance of architectural stripes in the population average maps. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we found that increasing boundary strengths facilitates the formation of the stacked boundary conformation, counter-intuitively facilitating border bypass. This work provides a revised view of the TAD borders&#39; function, both facilitating and preventing cis-regulatory interactions, and introduces a framework to distinguish border-crossing from border-respecting enhancer-promoter pairs.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Long, H., Chen, L.-F., Boettiger, A., &amp;amp; Wysocka, J.

These molecularly coordinated regions are named \&#34;variable chromatin modules\&#34; (VCMs), providing a conceptual framework of how regulatory variation might shape complex traits. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying VCM formation, here, we mechanistically dissect a VCM-modulating noncoding variant that is associated with reduced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) predisposition and disease progression. This common, germline variant constitutes a 5-bp indel that controls the activity of an AXIN2 gene-linked VCM by creating a MEF2 binding site, which, upon binding, activates a super-enhancer-like regulatory element. This triggers a large change in TF binding activity and chromatin state at an enhancer cluster spanning >150kb, coinciding with subtle, long-range chromatin compaction and robust AXIN2 up-regulation. Our results support a model in which the indel acts as an AXIN2 VCM-activating TF nucleation event, which modulates CLL pathology.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Xiao, J.

Although powerful, both techniques have limitations. Hi-C is challenging for low cell numbers and requires very deep sequencing to achieve its high resolution. In contrast, FISH can be done on small cell numbers and capture rare cell populations, but typically targets pairs of loci at a lower resolution. Here we detail a protocol for optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a microscopy approach to trace the 3D DNA path within the nuclei of fixed tissues and cultured cells with a genomic resolution as fine as 2 kb and a throughput of ~10,000 cells per experiment. ORCA can identify structural features with comparable resolution to Hi-C while providing single-cell resolution and multimodal measurements characteristic of microscopy. We describe how to use this DNA labeling in parallel with multiplexed labeling of dozens of RNAs to relate chromatin structure and gene expression in the same cells. Oligopaint probe design, primary probe making, sample collection, cryosectioning and RNA/DNA primary probe hybridization can be completed in 1.5 weeks, while automated RNA/DNA barcode hybridization and RNA/DNA imaging typically takes 2-6 d for data collection and 2-7 d for the automated steps of image analysis.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Rajpurkar, A.

APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Mateo, L. J., Murphy, S.

At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms, but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature16496\&#34;>DOI 10.1038/nature16496&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;wos\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_id=info:ut/000368354800051\&#34;>Web of Science ID 000368354800051&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26760202\&#34;>PubMedID 26760202&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med-central\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4905822\&#34;>PubMedCentralID PMC4905822&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nMetazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories.

Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the ~10(4) to 10(6) pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Boettiger, A.

These constitute a subset of promoter proximally paused genes for which mRNA elongation instead of promoter access is regulated. This difference can be described as a rearrangement of the regulatory topology to control the downstream transcriptional process of elongation rather than the upstream transcriptional initiation event. It has been shown experimentally that genes with the former mode of regulation tend to induce faster and more synchronously, and that promoter-proximal pausing is observed mainly in metazoans, in accord with a posited impact on synchrony. However, it has not been shown whether or not it is the change in the regulated step per se that is causal. We investigate this question by proposing and analyzing a continuous-time Markov chain model of PIC assembly regulated at one of two steps: initial polymerase association with DNA, or release from a paused, transcribing state. Our analysis demonstrates that, over a wide range of physical parameters, increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation control. Further, we make new predictions about the effect of elongation regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells. We also identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most sensitive to molecular noise and thus possibly the most evolutionarily constrained. Our methods produce symbolic expressions for quantities of interest with reasonable computational effort and they can be used to explore the interplay between interaction topology and molecular noise in a broader class of biochemical networks.

Dorsal controls DV patterning through the differential regulation of approximately 50 target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Whole-genome methods, including ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq assays, have identified approximately 100 Dorsal target enhancers, and more than one-third of these have been experimentally confirmed via transgenic embryo assays. Despite differences in DV patterning among divergent insects, a number of the Dorsal target enhancers are located in conserved positions relative to the associated transcription units. Thus, the evolution of novel patterns of gene expression might depend on the modification of old enhancers, rather than the invention of new ones. As many as half of all Dorsal target genes appear to contain \&#34;shadow\&#34; enhancers: a second enhancer that directs the same or similar expression pattern as the primary enhancer. Preliminary studies suggest that shadow enhancers might help to ensure resilience of gene expression in response to environmental and genetic perturbations.

Dorsal controls DV patterning through the differential regulation of approximately 50 target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Whole-genome methods, including ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq assays, have identified approximately 100 Dorsal target enhancers, and more than one-third of these have been experimentally confirmed via transgenic embryo assays. Despite differences in DV patterning among divergent insects, a number of the Dorsal target enhancers are located in conserved positions relative to the associated transcription units. Thus, the evolution of novel patterns of gene expression might depend on the modification of old enhancers, rather than the invention of new ones. As many as half of all Dorsal target genes appear to contain \&#34;shadow\&#34; enhancers: a second enhancer that directs the same or similar expression pattern as the primary enhancer. Preliminary studies suggest that shadow enhancers might help to ensure resilience of gene expression in response to environmental and genetic perturbations.

In addition, we demonstrate that the propagation of the waves of MAPK activation depends on the generation of reactive oxygen species at the wound edge.\nDOI: 10.1152/ajpcell.00411.2005, https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00411.2005\nWeb of Science ID: 000238287500009, https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:ut/000238287500009\nPubMedID: 16495370, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16495370&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1152/ajpcell.00411.2005&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00411.2005&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Jul 1, 2006 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Jul 1, 2006 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2006-07-01T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Nikolic, Djordje L. et al. “Role of Boundary Conditions in an Experimental Model of Epithelial Wound Healing.” &lt;i>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY&lt;/i> 291.1 (2006): C68–C75.

Recent experiments with Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial monolayers revealed a wave-like pattern of injury-induced MAPK activation and showed that it is essential for collective cell migration after wounding. To investigate the effects of the different aspects of wounding on cell sheet migration, we engineered a system that allowed us to dissect the classic wound healing assay. We studied Madin-Darby canine kidney sheet migration under three different conditions: 1) the classic wound healing assay, 2) empty space induction, where a confluent monolayer is grown adjacent to a slab of polydimethylsiloxane and the monolayer is not injured but allowed to migrate upon removal of the slab, and 3) injury via polydimethylsiloxane membrane peel-off, where an injured monolayer migrates onto plain tissue culture surface, as in the case of empty space induction allowing for direct comparison. By tracking the motion of individual cells within the sheet under these three conditions, we show how the dynamics of the individual cells&#39; motion is responsible for the coordinated migration of the sheet and is coordinated with the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK. In addition, we demonstrate that the propagation of the waves of MAPK activation depends on the generation of reactive oxygen species at the wound edge.&#34;}]" data-presentations="[]">

                    We study the development of pancreatic islet cells using molecular, embryologic and genetic methods in several model systems, including mice, pigs, human pancreas, embryonic stem cells, and Drosophila. Our work suggests that critical factors required for islet development are also needed to maintain essential functions of the mature islet. These approaches have informed efforts to generate replacement islets from renewable sources for diabetes.
