    <br>
    Jabalpur:</strong> City-based Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat (DUAS) has issued a fatwa against BJP leader S K Muddin ostracising him from the community over his triple talaq remarks with the the latter today hitting back saying he is going to file a defamation suit against the decree.</p>
  <p>Sunnis' Barelvi sect Islamic Study Centre's DUAS Mufti (cleric) Mohammad Asrar Ahmed Ashrafi issued the fatwa against Muddin, who is the MP Backward Classes and Minority Finance and Development Corporation vice president, on January 23 to ex-communicate him over his remark on triple talaq which he described as against Quran and Islamic Sharia, according to PTI.</p>
  <p>According to news clippings posted on S K Muddin's facebook page, the BJP leader also said that he will lead a masive campaign against triple talaq on January 31, 2017.</p>
  <p>&quot;We have serious differences on the issue with All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). Muslim Rashtriya Manch will organise a Vishal Mahila Sammelan of Muslim women against triple talaq on January 31&quot;, he said.</p>
  <p>He said divorce is permitted in Islam as the last option and under strict guidelines.</p>
  <p>&quot;If somebody decides to divorce his wife because of unavoidable reasons then it should be strictly done as per Islamic law, not arbitrarily&quot;, he said.  </p>
  <p>S K Muddin's statements however did not go down well with Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat (DUAS) and the organisation issued the fatwa against him and two others.</p>
  <p>The fatwa also says that if the trio apologises for their remark, they will be pardoned and allowed back into the community's fold.</p>
  <p>S K Muddin however refused to apologise and said he would file a defamation case against the organisation.</p>
  <p>&quot;We are with Shariat but against the triple talaq, which is against the tenets of Islam,&quot; Muddin told PTI Saturday.</p>
  <p>&quot;We are going to move court and file a defamation suit against the issuance of fatwa,&quot; he added.</p>
