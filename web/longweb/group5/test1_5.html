<meta name="description" content="This project accomplished the design and testing of an internal oil filter for a manual transmission of a heavy-duty truck. Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case. The final dimensions of the prototype were 2&quot; x 2&quot; x 5&quot;(Height x Width x Length). A series of prototypes were constructed with different design options. Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.">

<p>This project accomplished the design and testing of an internal oil filter for a manual transmission of a heavy-duty truck. Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case. The final dimensions of the prototype were 2" x 2" x 5"(Height x Width x Length). A series of prototypes were constructed with different design options. Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.</p>
